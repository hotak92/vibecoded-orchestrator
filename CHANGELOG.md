## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **`register_github_pat` ↔ SecretsPanel `module_id` unification**
  (post-0.2.0 backlog #6, 2026-05-10). The OnboardingWizard /
  `/preferences` Manage Token flow wrote the PAT at
  `vct._user_shared_.shared.installer/github_pat` while the SecretsPanel
  "Shared (this user)" tab wrote at
  `vct._user_shared_.shared.user/github_pat`. A user who registered via
  the wizard and later edited via the SecretsPanel ended up with two
  divergent keychain rows; reads from either path returned only that
  path's value, so the alternate row sat as a stale shadow. Both
  writers now use `module_id="user"` (the canonical user-bucket
  enforced by `is_user_emit_bucket`) and `vct-module.json::bundled_secrets[0].module_id`
  matches. Existing 0.2.0 installs are migrated on next
  `register_github_pat` call by `migrate_github_pat_installer_to_user_module_id`,
  which copies the value at the old `installer/` slot into the new
  `user/` slot (or, if both slots have values, keeps the user-bucket
  one because the SecretsPanel write happened later in time) and
  deletes the old keychain row plus its active-flag entry. Audited as
  `github_pat_module_id_migration` for traceability.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-08

Iteration since v0.1.6. Substantial install-flow architectural
overhaul, secrets-architecture overhaul, freeze-investigation
hardening, drift-guard work, and maintenance. Headline themes:

- **Secrets architecture overhaul** (PR #171, 2026-05-08):
  keychain-canonical for everything written through the launcher
  (Onboarding `register_github_pat` and the new `/preferences`
  Manage Token panel both write to the OS keychain, not to disk).
  Hub `/projects/{id}/env` resolver path is the canonical reader;
  bundled wrappers consume it via the new
  `templates/scripts/vct_secrets_resolve.{sh,ps1}` helper. Items
  H1-H4 close the per-project / cross-launcher / shared-tab gaps;
  the in-tree `claude_mcp_servers/search_mcp/wrapper.sh` reads
  `$GITHUB_TOKEN` env first, hub resolver second. The legacy
  `~/.vct-secrets/git-credential-vct` helper is retired in favour
  of per-project `GITHUB_TOKEN` env propagation. The user-facing
  `vct` CLI under `tools/vct-secrets/` is unchanged. See
  [docs/MIGRATION-0.2.0.md](docs/MIGRATION-0.2.0.md) for the full
  matrix and migration recipe.
- **Hub authentication gate** (item H5, 2026-05-08): the launcher
  hub at `127.0.0.1:7700` now requires
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every `/api/v1/*` route except
  `/api/v1/health`. The token is a fresh 32-byte CSPRNG value
  regenerated per launcher startup, persisted to
  `<vct_root_dir>/hub.token` (mode `0o600` on Unix). Closes the
  "any same-user process can curl localhost and exfiltrate the
  active secrets set" attack class. In-tree clients (resolver
  helpers, `vco` CLI, `hub_proxy`) read the token transparently.
- **Per-OS release archives** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`,
  2026-05-08): tag push (`v*.*.*`) builds and publishes
  `vibecoded-orchestrator-<version>-{linux-x64,macos-arm64,windows-x64}.{tar.gz,zip}`
  to GitHub Releases, with a `.sha256` sidecar each, alongside the
  existing standalone launcher binaries. SLSA build provenance
  attestation (Sigstore-signed) generated for the launcher binary
  inside each archive.
- **Non-destructive contract on user-owned files**: launcher
  unregister and `clear_github_pat` no longer rewrite or delete
  `.claude/env` outside the managed BEGIN/END block; user shell
  exports survive. The launcher never touches user-owned
  `~/.vct-secrets/projects/<project>/<key>` files written by the
  user-facing `vct` CLI.
- **Replace-existing guard on `register_github_pat`**: returns
  `EXISTS_DIFFERENT:<masked-prefix>` instead of silently
  overwriting a different PAT; GUI surfaces a confirm dialog.
  `force=true` proceeds with overwrite.
- **`/preferences` Manage Token UI**: rotate or clear the GitHub
  PAT outside the OnboardingWizard. Routes through the
  replace-existing guard above; "Clear" strips `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  from every registered project's env surface.
- **Install-flow overhaul** (PRs #139–#152, 2026-05-06): the
  user's "ONE VCO clone shared by all projects" model fully
  implemented. `ORCHESTRATOR_MANAGED_PATHS` as single source of
  truth (Rust + Python parse the same file). `ProjectEnvSettings`
  plumbs launcher state into per-project envs. Gitignore-aware
  `copy_recursive_sync`. Inspector + `update_orchestrator_at`
  gated by `validate_source_repo`. Codegraph venv resolution
  prefers `VCT_INSTALL_ROOT`.
- **New-user readiness** (PR #153, 2026-05-06/07): drift gate
  for `.claude/` ↔ `templates/` lockstep; GUI Option γ for non-FF
  auto-resync; `start-launcher.sh` build-hint fix.
- **Security + tightening** (PRs #154–#157, #163, 2026-05-07):
  tauri 2.11.0 → 2.11.1 CVE bump (origin confusion); cookie
  0.7.2 via npm overrides (Dependabot #1); BOM-strip in
  managed-paths parsers; `.vco-manifest.json` purge on unregister;
  codegraph mid-build unregister race silent.
- **Drift-guard fragility** (PRs #158, #162, #165, 2026-05-07):
  canonical env-key NAMES single source of truth (install ↔
  unregister structurally locked); CI cross-language
  managed-paths diff; full hook lockstep + sentinel rewire blocks
  for 7 PR-2-rewired scripts (drift gate's `EXPECTED_ASYMMETRIC`
  now empty).
- **UX polish + cleanliness** (PRs #159–#161, #164, 2026-05-07):
  `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}` placeholder in agent template subs;
  orchestrator-update banner clarification on per-project page;
  previously-registered leftovers banner in Add Project; gitignore
  hardening to prevent accidental RL Pro-tier IP leak.

Filed upstream:
- `anthropics/claude-code#56876` — `/tmp/claude-{uid}/.../tasks/`
  null-padded files (missing `ftruncate`).
- `tauri-apps/tauri#15353` — `generate_context!()` embeds
  `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` despite RUSTFLAGS remap.

Net change since v0.1.6: 23+ PRs to main; install flow
architecturally clean; all 4 declared Dependabot alerts triaged
or fixed.

## [0.1.1] – [0.1.5] — internal iterations

These versions existed only as internal pre-release iterations
during the 2026-04 → 2026-05 window. Substantive work happened
across many small commits without numbered releases; the
collected work landed as v0.1.6. Future released versions will
follow Keep a Changelog discipline more strictly per release.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-02

### Changed
- **Project install/update overhaul.** `create_project_v2` now bundles all
  orchestrator infrastructure on first install (hooks, scripts, agents,
  skills, MCP servers, per-project Weaviate collection bootstrap). New
  `update_project_v2` keeps installed projects in sync non-destructively
  via a manifest-based drift detector — user-modified files are preserved,
  conflicts produce a `.md` reference note for Claude Code to resolve.
  Schema migrations port existing collection data instead of recomputing
  embeddings. Install/init logic extracted into `vco_lib/project_init.py`
  as a single source of truth shared by launcher and CLI.
- **Asymmetric SHARED_KG semantics.** All projects can READ the shared
  knowledge graph; per-project toggle now gates only WRITES. Lets a
  project consume cross-project patterns without polluting the shared
  collection.
- **KG-update-nudge counter (v10.1).** Replaced the v9 `cache_creation`
  proxy (cost-accurate but work-blind) with a `work_units_total` formula
  that sums output tokens + bounded intake from Read/Write/Edit/Web/
  Agent/Bash. Thresholds: 175k first nudge, 50k subsequent. Per-tool
  caps prevent any single call from triggering on its own. Two
  adversarial Opus reviews validated the design.

### Added
- **Full cross-OS hook parity.** Every `.sh` hook now ships with a
  matching `.ps1` sibling. macOS bash 3.2 quirks fixed (no `[[ ]]`
  regex, no `${var,,}`, no associative arrays). Zero `OS-EXEMPT-PARITY`
  shortcuts.
- **Bytecode pre-compile (Step 11b).** New default-on install step runs
  `python -m compileall` on orchestrator Python directories so first
  import is ~50-200ms faster per cold module. Opt-out via `--no-compile`
  (Linux/macOS) or `-NoCompile` (Windows). Best-effort: per-directory
  failures warn but never abort. Cross-OS via stdlib `compileall`.
- Vercel token-leak guard hook bundled into installed projects.
- AMD ROCm overlay + VRAM-aware Ollama model selection.
- Phase 1 `~/.vct-secrets/` shared/per-project secret layout with
  legacy-path fallback.

### Fixed
- Bare `KG_COLLECTION` bug across all 4 env surfaces; canonical
  per-project collection naming end-to-end.
- KG-nudge baseline reset on `Edit`/`Write` to any `**/knowledge/**.md`
  (not only project-local).
- Agent effort frontmatter recalibrated per-model (Opus 4.7 caps
  `xhigh`, Haiku → `high`).

### Security
- Setup docs use placeholders (`<YOUR_LS_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET>`,
  `<YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF>`) with instructions to generate via
  `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- Added `scripts/check-no-secrets.sh` pre-commit grep guard with a
  blocklist of token patterns to keep them out of commits.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-26 — Initial private release

### Added
- VCT Launcher v1.0 + v1.1 (Tauri 2 desktop app): 17 GUI screens including project management, KG / code-graph dashboards, audit log, modules catalog, license activation, settings, onboarding wizard.
- Knowledge Graph with semantic search (Weaviate + qwen3-embedding 1024-dim, optional OpenAI vectors, GraphRAG-style WikiLink traversal).
- Code Graph (Python AST + regex-based analysis across 9 languages, 5 entity types: `CodeModule`, `CodeClass`, `CodeFunction`, `CodeAPI`, `CodeInteraction`; optional Joern integration for CFG / PDG).
- 20 automation hooks (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SessionStart`, `Stop`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `StopFailure`, `SessionEnd`, …).
- 4 MCP servers: `weaviate-kg`, `ollama`, `search`, `code-embedding`.
- 19 agents + 28 skills as templates dropped into `.claude/` at install time.
- Multi-surface compatibility: Claude Code CLI + VS Code extension + Claude Code Desktop app.
- Per-project env injection via `.claude/settings.json` (Anthropic-canonical) + `.vscode/settings.json` (VS Code) + `.claude/env` (CLI shell). User code is never touched.
- Container runtime support for podman and docker; shared services across projects on a single machine.
- License validator: free tier fail-open (so a flaky network never breaks startup), optional Pro / Admin tiers via Lemon Squeezy with a 3-day offline grace window.
- Local-only architecture: Weaviate + Ollama on-device; no data leaves the machine without explicit user consent.

### Security
- Hard whitelist for orchestrator-managed paths (zero-touch user code).
- Pre-flight install-safety check (`preflight_install_safety_check` Tauri command).
- Read-merge-write for all settings files (preserves user content).
- Atomic write patterns for `~/.claude.json` and `.vscode/settings.json`.
- No destructive container ops anywhere in install path (audit-tested).
- OS-keychain-backed secret storage (no plaintext on disk).
- Default-OFF telemetry (explicit opt-in required; default `.env` writes `VIBECODED_TELEMETRY=false`).
- Public alias for license validation (`https://api.vibecodedtools.it/validate-tier`); internal Supabase URLs are not committed to public source.
